# 1) Airbus a330 Model Design
This report presents the design and modeling of an Airbus A330 commercial aircraft using Autodesk Fusion 360. The objective was to create a parametric CAD model of the aircraft geometry with emphasis on realistic aerodynamic features, structural considerations, and overall aesthetic resemblance to the Airbus A330.

## 1) A Brief Note.
The Airbus A330 is a wide-body airliner developed and produced by Airbus. Airbus began developing larger A300 derivatives in the mid–1970s, giving rise to the A330 twinjet as well as the Airbus A340 quadjet, and launched both designs along with their first orders in June 1987. The A330-300, the first variant, took its maiden flight in November 1992 and entered service with Air Inter in January 1994.

The first specifications for the TA9 and TA11, aircraft that could accommodate 410 passengers in a one-class layout, emerged in 1982.[13] They showed a large underfloor cargo area that could hold five cargo pallets or sixteen LD3 cargo containers in the forward, and four pallets or fourteen LD3s in the aft hold—double the capacity of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar or DC-10, and 8.46 metres (27.8 ft) longer than the Airbus A300.

In preparation for the production of the A330 and the A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. In south-western England, BAe made a £7 million investment in a three-storey technical centre with 15,000 m2 (161,000 sq ft) of floor area at Filton.[26] In north Wales, BAe also spent £5 million on a new production line at its Broughton wing production plant.

## 1) Design Objectives 

1) Develop a 3D CAD model of an Airbus A330 using Autodesk Fusion 360.
2) Select and apply suitable airfoils for different wing sections.
3)Ensure realistic geometry for the empennage (horizontal and vertical stabilizers).
4) Balance aerodynamic performance with manufacturability and structural needs.

## 2) CAD Modeling Approach
The aircraft geometry was modeled in a modular approach:

1) Fuselage – Created using lofted profiles along the aircraft centerline to achieve a streamlined cylindrical body with cockpit shaping.
2) Wings – Designed using airfoil sections at root, mid-span, and tip, connected via lofted blends to ensure smooth aerodynamic transitions.
3) Empennage – Modeled with symmetrical NACA sections for stability surfaces.
4) Engines & Nacelles – Cylindrical extrusions with aerodynamic fairings, positioned under the wings.

## 3) Wing Design and Airfoil Selection
The wing is the most critical aerodynamic component of the Airbus A330. To optimize lift, drag, and structural volume, different airfoils were applied along the span. The dihedral angle for the wings is 6 degrees.

Wing Location	Airfoil	Thickness	Remarks
### Root	
NASA SC(2)-0612	12%	Provides structural volume for fuel storage and landing gear support.
### Mid-Span	
NASA SC(2)-0609	9%	Balances aerodynamic efficiency with bending strength.

## 4) Empennage (Stabilizer) Design

The empennage, consisting of the horizontal stabilizer and vertical fin, primarily provides stability and control authority rather than lift. Therefore, symmetrical airfoils were used:

### NACA 0009 to NACA 0012: 
These airfoils offer low drag, predictable performance at small angles of attack, and structural efficiency.

### Horizontal Stabilizer: 
Designed with NACA 0010 for balance between stability and lightweight design.

### Vertical Stabilizer (Fin): 
Modeled with NACA 0012 for higher control authority, especially during yaw corrections.

## 5) CFD Analysis
This model is a created replica using the blueprints provided. The technical difficulties arose in the deign are:
1) Topological errors.
2) Improper Meshing.
3) Design accuracy and Flaws.

## 6) Conclusion
The Airbus A330 CAD model demonstrates the integration of aerodynamic theory, airfoil selection, and structural considerations in a commercial aircraft design. The use of NASA SC(2) airfoils ensures aerodynamic efficiency, while symmetrical NACA profiles for the stabilizers provide stability and control.


# 2) Assembly & Simulation
The tasks includes to design a robotic arm gripper using the Fusion 360 Software. The design parameters are in mm. This is a **Pneumatic Gripper** which is used in many industry scale applications.

# 3) Computational Fluid Dynamics
This task involves performing Computational fluid behaviour on the Airfoil we designed in the previous task. The environment which is used is air. The input velocity hitting the camber line is 50 m/s and the output is 0m/s. The airfoil chosen is NACA2414. 25 iterations have been successfully performed on the airfoil.
