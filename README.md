# 1) Airbus a330 Model Design
This report presents the design and modeling of an Airbus A330 commercial aircraft using Autodesk Fusion 360. The objective was to create a parametric CAD model of the aircraft geometry with emphasis on realistic aerodynamic features, structural considerations, and overall aesthetic resemblance to the Airbus A330.

## 1) Design Objectives 

1) Develop a 3D CAD model of an Airbus A330 using Autodesk Fusion 360.
2) Select and apply suitable airfoils for different wing sections.
3)Ensure realistic geometry for the empennage (horizontal and vertical stabilizers).
4) Balance aerodynamic performance with manufacturability and structural needs.

## 2) CAD Modeling Approach
The aircraft geometry was modeled in a modular approach:

1) Fuselage – Created using lofted profiles along the aircraft centerline to achieve a streamlined cylindrical body with cockpit shaping.
2) Wings – Designed using airfoil sections at root, mid-span, and tip, connected via lofted blends to ensure smooth aerodynamic transitions.
3) Empennage – Modeled with symmetrical NACA sections for stability surfaces.
4) Engines & Nacelles – Cylindrical extrusions with aerodynamic fairings, positioned under the wings.

## 3) Wing Design and Airfoil Selection
The wing is the most critical aerodynamic component of the Airbus A330. To optimize lift, drag, and structural volume, different airfoils were applied along the span:

Wing Location	Airfoil	Thickness	Remarks
### Root	
NASA SC(2)-0612	12%	Provides structural volume for fuel storage and landing gear support.
### Mid-Span	
NASA SC(2)-0609	9%	Balances aerodynamic efficiency with bending strength.

## 4) Empennage (Stabilizer) Design

The empennage, consisting of the horizontal stabilizer and vertical fin, primarily provides stability and control authority rather than lift. Therefore, symmetrical airfoils were used:

### NACA 0009 to NACA 0012: 
These airfoils offer low drag, predictable performance at small angles of attack, and structural efficiency.

### Horizontal Stabilizer: 
Designed with NACA 0010 for balance between stability and lightweight design.

### Vertical Stabilizer (Fin): 
Modeled with NACA 0012 for higher control authority, especially during yaw corrections.

## 5) Conclusion

The Airbus A330 CAD model demonstrates the integration of aerodynamic theory, airfoil selection, and structural considerations in a commercial aircraft design. The use of NASA SC(2) airfoils ensures aerodynamic efficiency, while symmetrical NACA profiles for the stabilizers provide stability and control.
