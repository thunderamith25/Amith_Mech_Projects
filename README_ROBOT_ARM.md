# Introduction

This project showcases my next-gen Industrial Robot Arm, fully modeled in Autodesk Fusion 360. It is an Industrail robot with 6 links and a tool holder to insert the respective tools.

## 🛠️ Design Process

Creating this beast wasn’t just about drawing lines—it was about crafting a functional masterpiece. Here’s the journey step by step:

1) Concept Sketching ✏️ – Initial sketches to define arm proportions, reach, and base stability.

2) 3D Modeling in Fusion 360 – Built component by component (base, links, joints, toolholder) 

3) Assembly 🔗 – Brought together multiple parts into a fully articulated robotic structure.

4) Joints defined for 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF).

## 🚀 Key Features

1) 6 Degrees of Freedom – High flexibility for industrial tasks.

2) Reach: ~1.2 m – enough to cover a standard workstation.

3) Lightweight & Durable – Designed with aluminum alloy links and reinforced base.

4) Industrial Aesthetic 🎨 – A sleek design that screams next-gen robotics.

## 📊 Materials used
1) Base : Stainless steel for good fixture and weight.
2) Links : Aluminium alloys.
3) Tool Holder : Stainless steel for stronger grip on the tool.

## 🎯 Conclusion

This project isn’t just CAD—it’s the first step towards me desiggning a functional industrial-grade robot arm. With modular design, realistic motion planning, and a sleek professional look, it’s ready to inspire engineers students like me to create such designs
